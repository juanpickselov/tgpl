The Go Programming Language from Addison Wesley

## To Go with the Book

Note: I'm not worrying about the subdirectory structure just yet and the error handling is missing from a lot of the code so far, to be handled later
This code is from the book with minor naming changes from me, some solutions found out there on the world wide web.

The book doesn't cover several things early on and like Daniel says, it's unfortunate they don't cover testing sooner!

I'm learning as I Go!
